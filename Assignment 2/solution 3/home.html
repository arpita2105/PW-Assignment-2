   <p> Hi, I'm <strong>Arpita</strong>, a web developer crafting digital experiences.<br> Join me on this coding journey as we explore web insights, tips, and the art of creating online magic. <br>Let's build the future of the web together. <br></p>
<p>
   I think that people should look at the bigger picture when they are building something. I love to work in groups where everyone can voice their opinions and ideas. In the end, I love to work towards one goal where in the end we all can contribute towards making a good website. <br>
    In my free time, you can see me listening to songs and binge-watching series.
